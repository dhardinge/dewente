Chrome extension to hide Margaret Wente's Globe and Mail columns

<h2>Dewente</h2>

#About
Dewente is a Chrome browser extension that block's Margaret Wente's columns from your view of the Globe and Mail's website. Simply install the plugin and you will never again regret clicking through to her articles.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
Install the plugin by visiting <a href='https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/inpfoelkegplmfeepmnibpnfchpnfkpp?hl=en'>this link.</a>  Note that you must be running the Chrome browser as this is a Chrome extension.
</p>

<h3>Incognito Mode</h3>
<p>
The Globe and Mail paywall can be avoided by running Chrome in Incognito mode.  However, by default, Chrome extensions are not enabled in Incognito mode, so if you use this mode to visite the G and M site, you will need to enable the plugin manually.
</p>
<p>
To enable the extension in Incognito mode, enter <b>chrome://extensions/</b> into the browser bar, then scroll down to the <b>Dewente</b> plugin.  Check the <b>allow in incognito</b> checkbox.
